# Extended Ray-Tracer
Improvements on my Ray-tracer. Specifically, focused on implementing lens mechanics to more realistically simulate camera features.

### Overview
My project aims to create visually powerful renders of 3-D scenes by simulating realistic light physics and by simulating camera effects. It parses through JSON files that contain the scene description. The 3-D objects in the scene are defined mathematically using implicit equations. Light rays are generated and then traced through the scene to compute their interactions with the shapes using the ray-tracing algorithm. I handle the final color computation by implememnting the renowned Phong Illumination Model.
